### 1.1 : About Dataset.
In this project, we used the CUMULO comparative datasets. In this project, we used the CUMULO comparative datasets. This dataset consists of one-year 1km resolution MODIS hyperspectral images combined with pixel-width 'traces' of CloudSat cloud tags. Bringing these complementary datasets together is a crucial first step that enables the Machine Learning community to develop innovative new techniques that can greatly benefit the Climate community.

## 1. 

In this project, I tried to classification clouds with the CUMULO dataset.
